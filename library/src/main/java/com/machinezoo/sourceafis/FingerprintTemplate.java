/**
 * Biometric description of a fingerprint suitable for efficient matching.
 * Fingerprint template holds high-level fingerprint features, specifically ridge endings and bifurcations (together called minutiae).
 * Original image is not preserved in the fingerprint template and there is no way to reconstruct the original fingerprint from its template.
 * <p>
 * Fingerprint image can be converted to template by calling {@link #create(byte[])} method
 * on an empty fingerprint template instantiated with {@link #FingerprintTemplate()} constructor.
 * Image DPI may be specified first by calling {@link #dpi(double)}.
 * <p>
 * Since image processing is expensive, applications should cache serialized templates.
 * Serialization into JSON format is performed by {@link #serialize()} method.
 * JSON template can be deserialized by calling {@link #deserialize(String)}.
 * on an empty fingerprint template instantiated with {@link #FingerprintTemplate()} constructor.
 * <p>
 * Matching is performed by constructing {@link FingerprintMatcher},
 * passing probe fingerprint to its {@link FingerprintMatcher#index(FingerprintTemplate)} method,
 * and then passing candidate fingerprints to its {@link FingerprintMatcher#match(FingerprintTemplate)} method.
 * <p>
 * {@code FingerprintTemplate} contains two kinds of data: fingerprint features and search data structures.
 * Search data structures speed up matching at the cost of some RAM.
 * Only fingerprint features are serialized. Search data structures are recomputed after every deserialization.
 *
